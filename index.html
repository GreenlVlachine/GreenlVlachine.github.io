      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my professional ePortfolio. This page showcases the skills and milestones I’ve developed in Android application design and development. It includes my self-assessment, code review, and the enhancements made throughout my coursework in mobile software engineering.

      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Before setting out to begin my Computer Science degree, I hadn't even dabbled in learning a programming language - all of my work experience was in the medical field, where I became a surgical technologist through the military as soon as I finished high school. I can recall growing up,
        I had always wanted to make games...I loved playing them, and always thought it would be so cool to get under the hood myself. This is still my long-term goal, even if I must first cultivate experience in an adjacent field, such as security or quality assurance. This ePortfolio aims to
        showcase the progress I've made from learning my first programming language to making impactful augmentations to my chosen technical artifact.  Looking back on my journey, I am confident in using my newly learned skills and abilities to continue evolving as a developer, and to leverage
        my organizational skills and discipline from my previous career in the operating room to produce professional, quality products.
        [Placeholder: Write a concise overview of your learning journey, growth as a developer, and goals moving forward. Mention transferable skills from your surgical technology background and how they contribute to your work in software development.]

    <!-- Code Review -->
    <section id="code-review">
      <h2>Code Review</h2>
      <p>
        [Placeholder: Summarize your code review process and the specific codebase reviewed (e.g., Android Weight Tracker). Discuss what you learned about writing maintainable, efficient, and secure code.]
