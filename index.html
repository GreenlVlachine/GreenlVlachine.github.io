      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Before setting out to begin my Computer Science degree, I hadn't even dabbled in learning a programming language - all of my work experience was in the medical field. I became a surgical technologist through the military as soon as I finished high school. I can recall growing up,
        I had always wanted to make games...I loved playing them, and always thought it would be so cool to get under the hood myself. This is still my long-term goal, even if I must first cultivate experience in an adjacent field, such as security or quality assurance. This ePortfolio aims to
        showcase the progress I've made from learning my first programming language to making impactful augmentations to my chosen technical artifact.  Looking back on my journey, I am confident in using my newly learned skills and abilities to continue evolving as a software developer, and to 
        leverage my organizational skills and discipline from my previous career in the operating room to produce professional, quality products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my curriculum, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both the technical and collaborative aspects of software development. Early courses such as Software Analysis and Design introduced me to Agile and Scrum methodologies, emphasizing the importance of communication, role clarity,
        and teamwork in the software lifecycle. From there, I built practical skills in data structures, algorithms, and software security, gaining hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities and adhering to secure coding standards. I explored the user-centered side of development through
        UI/UX design, practiced implementing emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, and expanded my technical versatility through mobile and full-stack development. Collectively, these experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded developer capable of approaching 
        problems from multiple perspectives — analytical, creative, and security-minded — while maintaining a commitment to producing high-quality, maintainable code.
      </p>

        For this capstone, we had instructions to perform augmentations on pre-existing coursework that addressed three categories: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I made the early decision to choose my Android Studio application from CS-360 for all 
        three milestones - while it may not show as much variety, I felt this was the best way to measure my personal growth. Many projects in the curriculum involved a pre-existing codebase that we would then modify with our newly learned skills, but this Android application is entirely mine.
        The project was developed using Java syntax and Android SDK, and it includes multiple databases that use SQLite. The purpose of the app was for users to select a goal weight, and then log their weights in a database to monitor their progress. Before making any modifications, the app illustrated
        a foundational understanding of development practices, such as database integration and CRUD operations, UI/UX design, and data integrity. Reflecting on my work while implementing the augmentations allowed me to achieve important course outcomes:
      <ul>
        <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.</li>
        <li>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</li>
        <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</li>
        <li>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</li>
      </ul>
